## KVM Config guide

This set of documents covers standing up a Debian Stable server, installing KVM, and building out the 4 virtual machines used in the cluster using Terraform.

My server is a Supermicro `X9SCL/X9SCM` with an 8-core `Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1230 V2 @ 3.30GHz` and 32 GB of ECC RAM. It's old, but what matters is having enough RAM. 4 CPU cores and 16GB of RAM is adaquete.
